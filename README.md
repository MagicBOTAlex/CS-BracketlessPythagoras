# CS-BracketlessPythagoras
Small project about the un-used C# goto statement
## About
I have been wanting to create a project where the obscure C# goto statement finally gets used. For this project, I have decided to create a pythagoras calculator, which takes the inputs of side a and b to get the length of the side c on a right triangle.

My main objective with this project is to annoy my teachers with this fully functional program that uses soo many goto statements.


## Small notes
##### I started the project, not knowing what my program was. That is the reason for the name of the solution and name.

###### If you want me to change the lincense for this repo, for some reason. You can message a request for me.
